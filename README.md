# KnitScripts

KnitScripts.py is a simple python program script and GUI built with Python's tkinter package. The KnitGauge option allows a user to obtain a new stitch or row count given a yarn with a different stitch/row count from that used in the original pattern. The YarnConverter option allows a user to determine the correct needle size to use when working with two strands of yarn with varying weights/lengths.

KnitScriptsV2.py is a derivative of KnitScripts.py that creates a local database to store prior input and output values. The UI contains a new "Query" button that allows the user to query all available data within the database and generate a dated Excel file containing the timestamp, input values, and output for each usage of the KnitGauge or YarnConverter functions.
