# KnitScripts
KnitScripts.py is a simple python program script and GUI built with Python's tkinter package. The KnitGauge option allows a user to obtain a new stitch or row count given a yarn with a different stitch/row count from that used in the original pattern. The YarnConverter option allows a user to determine the correct needle size to use when working with two strands of yarn with varying weights/lengths.
